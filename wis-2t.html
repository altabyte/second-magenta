            <p>
                Windshield 2T Modeller (<strong>WIS 2T</strong>) is a software tool to assist in the design of
                heated windscreens for aircraft and locomotive applications.
                <strong>WIS 2T</strong> brings together two separate design functions into one software package.

                    <h3>Anti-icing performance</h3>
                    WIS 2T predicts the power density requirements for anti-icing with electrically
                    heated windscreens in accordance with both <strong>SAE AIR1168/4</strong> and
                    <strong>AFML-TR-73-126</strong> (Letton).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Thermal performance</h3>
                    <strong>WIS 2T</strong> predicts the steady-state and dynamic temperature distribution
                    throughout a coated laminated windscreen based on user-definable environment.
